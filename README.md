# Abasyn University Internship Projects

# This internship allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems and strengthen my practical skills in AI, data analysis, and machine learning.

# Projects
# 1. Transformer-Based Chatbot

Developed a conversational AI chatbot using Hugging Face’s BlenderBot (90M).

Implemented sequence-to-sequence text generation for interactive responses.

Provided hands-on experience with tokenization, model inference, and NLP pipelines.

# 2. NLP Spam Detection System

Built a system to detect spam in SMS and email messages.

Leveraged TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression.

Developed an interactive Gradio interface for real-time testing of messages.

# 3. KNN Classifier on Iris Dataset

Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier for multi-class classification.

Applied 2D and 3D PCA visualizations to demonstrate dimensionality reduction and class separability.

Achieved high classification accuracy while gaining experience in data preprocessing and visualization.
